# myhangul
A Javascript program written to teach Hangul

My goal was to start at the very beginning of Hangul study, for people who know absolutely nothing about it, but also include reasonably advanced principles of pronunciation as well. The program is not intended to teach Korean vocabulary or grammar. The intended audience is native English speakers. Ultimately, I tried to strike a balance between precision and informality, simplicity and accuracy, accessibility and comprehensiveness.
